Javascript Password Generator 

In order to practice better and start from a place I understood more, I reworked and rewrote the assignment code.
Some of this code has been influenced by Traversy Media's video:

Below are the reworkings to make the Password Generator function:

1). In HTML, an input form was added with elements correlating to password characteristics
2). In Javascript, variables were set in arrays for eventual random selection/password creation
3). In Javascript, DOM Elements were created and linked to HTML id elements
4). In Javascript, variables were put into an object titled "randomFunction" 
5). In Javascript, event listeners were created correlated to the form field and linked to the Generate Button, in order to check with a click if values were typed and checked
6). In Javascript, a Generate Password function was created inlcuding typeCounts and typeArrays to call in object variables
7). In Javascript, the Generate Passwrod function placed elements into if and for methods to test of elements were true or false and correlated to lenght
8). In Javascript, functions were created to randomize variables with the Math.floor and Math.random methods
